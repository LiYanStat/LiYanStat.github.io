Keep tex source file clean and tidy. Make everything easy to read and\rcompare. No extra spacing or indention, and two blank lines for\rseparating paragraph. Make line width under 80. While do not limit\rmath expression to 80. Break math expression at right places.\n2. Make notations, equations precise and concise, and explain clearly\rmeaning of each notation. Do not use abbreviation if unnecessary. The\rnotations should be consistent through the paper. Leave enough spaces\rso the formulas become more readable even in source and only number\requation if itâ€™s referenced. 3. When citing a paper, do not cite the reviewing paper, cite the\roriginal paper. 4. The caption of table and figure should be self contained. Make\rsure others can under- stand the figures or tables by reading the\rcaption.\n5. Tables should be formatted in logical order to make the tables\reasy to follow. Content in one column should be consistent. Do not\rchange the font size in table. Reformat the table to fit the page.\n6. In introduction section, when doing literature review, one\rshould make connection to the paper. Do not just describe the previous\rwork. And the introduction should be in logical order to make it easy\rto follow.\n7. Always explain the unusual findings in the numerical studies\rsection, and also consider addressing other questions that the readers\rmay ask.\n","date":1707350400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1707350400,"objectID":"0134bde0b61f138025ccfb176ac04e2b","permalink":"https://yanlistat.com/post/2018-09-11-writing_paper/","publishdate":"2024-02-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2018-09-11-writing_paper/","section":"post","summary":"When writing a scientific paper, maintaining good habits will make your paper easy to follow for both collaborators and yourself.","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Several Things for Writing Statistical Paper","type":"post"}]
